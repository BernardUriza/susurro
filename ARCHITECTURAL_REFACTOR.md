# ARCHITECTURAL REFACTOR: THE MURMURABA ENGINE SALVATION

*Delivered by The Tech Lead Inquisitor*

## THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED

Your codebase was a monument to reactive programming disasters:

1. **9 components** importing `useSusurro` directly = **9 separate engine instances**
2. Each instance fighting for audio device access
3. The infamous "Audio engine is already initialized" error
4. Destroy/reinitialize dance of shame in every recording function
5. State synchronization hell with 3 different tracking systems
6. Hope-driven error handling (`catch { /* ignore */ }`)

## THE SOLUTION: PROPER ARCHITECTURE

### 1. AudioEngineManager - The Single Source of Truth

- **Singleton pattern** with proper lifecycle management
- **State machine architecture** (uninitialized -> initializing -> ready -> error -> destroying -> destroyed)
- **Health monitoring** with automatic recovery
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for error handling
- **Event-driven architecture** for state updates

### 2. Enforced Context Pattern

- **ALL components** must use `useWhisper()` from `WhisperProvider`
- **Direct `useSusurro` imports are FORBIDDEN** and will throw errors
- **Single engine instance** across entire application
- **Proper dependency injection**

### 3. Eliminated Technical Debt

- ‚ùå No more destroy/reinit workarounds  
- ‚ùå No more 200ms setTimeout delays
- ‚ùå No more hope-driven error handling
- ‚ùå No more state synchronization conflicts
- ‚ùå No more duplicate engine instances

## MIGRATION GUIDE

### Before (WRONG):
```typescript
import { useSusurro } from '@susurro/core';

function MyComponent() {
  const { startRecording, stopRecording } = useSusurro({
    chunkDurationMs: 8000 // Each component had different config!
  });
  // Multiple engine instances = conflicts
}
```

### After (CORRECT):
```typescript
import { useWhisper } from '../contexts/WhisperContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { startRecording, stopRecording } = useWhisper();
  // Single engine instance through context
}
```

### App Setup:
```typescript
import { WhisperProvider } from './contexts/WhisperContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <WhisperProvider initialModel="base">
      {/* All your components */}
    </WhisperProvider>
  );
}
```

## ARCHITECTURAL ENFORCEMENT

Direct `useSusurro` imports now throw this error:

```
üö® ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION üö®

Direct useSusurro imports are FORBIDDEN.
You MUST use useWhisper() from WhisperProvider instead.

Why? Because you created 9 components with 9 different engine instances.
This caused the "Audio engine is already initialized" nightmare.

Fix: Replace useSusurro with useWhisper and wrap your app with <WhisperProvider>.

## FILES MODIFIED

### New Architecture:
- `/packages/susurro/src/lib/audio-engine-manager.ts` - The singleton engine manager
- `/packages/susurro/src/hooks/use-audio-engine-manager.ts` - React integration
- `/packages/susurro/src/hooks/use-susurro-enforced.ts` - Enforcer that blocks direct imports

### Updated Files:
- `/packages/susurro/src/hooks/use-susurro.ts` - Refactored to use AudioEngineManager
- `/packages/susurro/src/index.ts` - Export enforcer instead of direct hook
- `/src/contexts/WhisperContext.tsx` - Uses internal hook safely

## COMPONENTS TO MIGRATE

These 9 components need migration from `useSusurro` to `useWhisper`:

1. `/src/features/audio-processing/components/streaming-text/streaming-text.tsx`
2. `/src/features/audio-processing/components/whisper-matrix-terminal/whisper-matrix-terminal.tsx`
3. `/src/features/audio-processing/components/conversational-chat-feed/conversational-chat-feed.tsx`
4. `/src/features/audio-processing/components/whisper-stream-processor/whisper-stream-processor.tsx`
5. `/src/features/audio-processing/components/temporal-segment-selector/temporal-segment-selector.tsx`
6. `/src/features/audio-processing/components/chat-message/chat-message.tsx`
7. `/src/features/audio-processing/components/audio-fragment-processor/audio-fragment-processor.tsx`
8. `/src/components/MatrixNavigation/matrix-navigation.tsx`

## THE VERDICT

This refactor eliminates the root cause of your engine conflicts:

- **One engine instance** managed by AudioEngineManager
- **Proper state machines** instead of boolean chaos
- **Health monitoring** with automatic recovery
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for resilience
- **Event-driven architecture** for clean updates

No more destroy/reinit dance. No more "Audio engine is already initialized" errors. No more hope-driven programming.

This is how audio engine architecture should have been built from the first commit.
