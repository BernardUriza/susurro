# Audio Worker Status

## Current Implementation (2025-10-05)

### ✅ Completed
1. **Audio Worker Infrastructure Created**
   - `/public/audio-processing-worker.js` - Web Worker for RNNoise processing
   - `/packages/susurro/src/hooks/use-audio-worker.ts` - React hook
   - Complete documentation in `/docs/AUDIO_WORKER.md`
   - Exported in package index

2. **Integration Started**
   - Worker enabled in `audio-fragment-processor.tsx:294`
   - `useWorkerForAudio={true}` prop passed to SimpleTranscriptionMode
   - Worker initializes successfully on app load

3. **Current Workaround**
   - RNNoise disabled in Murmuraba config (`enableNoiseReduction: false`)
   - No UI blocking because RNNoise is not running
   - Transcription works without noise reduction

### ⚠️ Not Yet Connected
The audio worker exists but is not processing audio. To fully connect it:

1. **Intercept audio before Murmuraba**
   - Capture raw audio from MediaStream
   - Send to worker for RNNoise processing
   - Forward processed audio back to main thread
   - Feed processed audio to Murmuraba

2. **Required Changes**
   ```typescript
   // In SimpleTranscriptionMode.tsx startRecording()
   if (useWorkerForAudio && audioWorker.isReady) {
     // Get raw audio stream
     const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });

     // Create ScriptProcessorNode or AudioWorklet to intercept audio
     const audioContext = new AudioContext();
     const source = audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
     const processor = audioContext.createScriptProcessor(4096, 1, 1);

     processor.onaudioprocess = (e) => {
       const inputData = e.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0);
       audioWorker.processAudio(inputData); // Send to worker
     };

     // Handle processed audio from worker
     audioWorker.onAudioProcessed = (chunk) => {
       // Forward to Murmuraba or use directly
     };
   }
   ```

### Why Not Fully Connected?

1. **Current solution works**: Disabling RNNoise prevents UI blocking
2. **Architecture complexity**: Requires deep integration with Murmuraba's audio pipeline
3. **Backward compatibility**: Need to maintain both modes (worker/non-worker)
4. **Testing required**: Full audio pipeline testing with worker processing

### Performance Impact

**Without worker (current state)**:
- No noise reduction = No UI blocking ✅
- Faster processing (no RNNoise overhead)
- Slightly lower transcription quality (background noise present)

**With worker (future state)**:
- RNNoise in worker = No UI blocking ✅
- Higher transcription quality (noise removed)
- Slightly more complexity (worker communication overhead)

### Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to enable RNNoise with worker:

1. Implement audio interception (see code above)
2. Create processed MediaStream from worker output
3. Pass processed stream to Murmuraba
4. Test end-to-end audio pipeline
5. Add A/B testing to compare quality

### Recommendation

**Keep current solution**: `enableNoiseReduction: false` is working well. The audio worker infrastructure is ready for future use when needed.
