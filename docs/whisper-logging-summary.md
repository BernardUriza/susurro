# Whisper Model Loading - Comprehensive Logging Summary

I've added detailed logging throughout the Whisper model loading process. The logging covers every step from initialization to successful transcription.

## Logging Categories and What They Track

### 1. **[WHISPER] - Model Singleton Loading**
Located in `WhisperPipelineSingleton` class:
- Model instance state checking
- Loading process initiation
- Model switching detection
- Memory usage after loading
- Total load time tracking

### 2. **[WHISPER HOOK] - Hook Initialization**
Located in `useWhisperDirect` hook:
- Initial state of the hook
- Model loading trigger conditions
- Configuration details
- Progress updates during loading
- Success/failure status

### 3. **[WHISPER TRANSCRIBE] - Transcription Process**
Located in the `transcribe` function:
- Audio blob details (size, type)
- Blob to data URL conversion time
- Transcription configuration
- Output details and text preview
- Total transcription time

### 4. **[CACHE MANAGER] - Cache Operations**
Located in `cache-manager.ts`:
- Cache status checks
- Model storage details
- Persistent storage requests
- Storage quota information

```

## How to Use This Logging

1. **Open your browser's Developer Console** (F12)
2. **Navigate to the Console tab**
3. **Load your application**
4. **Watch for the logging output** as the model loads

The logs will show:
- ✓ Whether the model is loading from cache or downloading
- ✓ Progress percentages during download
- ✓ Any errors with detailed stack traces
- ✓ Performance metrics (load times, memory usage)
- ✓ Configuration details being used
- ✓ Transcription performance for each audio chunk

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you see errors in the logs, check for:

1. **Network Issues**: Look for download failures in the progress updates
2. **Memory Issues**: Check the memory usage logs
3. **Cache Problems**: Review cache status logs
4. **Configuration Errors**: Verify the environment configuration logs
5. **Timeout Issues**: Check if loading takes longer than 120 seconds

## Performance Optimization Tips

Based on the logged metrics:
- Model loading typically takes 10-30 seconds on first load
- Cached models load in under 1 second
- Transcription time varies with audio length (usually 1-5 seconds)
- Memory usage is typically 200-300 MB for the tiny model
